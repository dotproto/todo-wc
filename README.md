# NOTES

For the first revision of this repo, I'm going to assume that your browser natively supports Web Components V1, but not ES6 modules (`import`/`export`). Specifically, that means the following specs:

* Custom Elements V1 - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements
* Shadow DOM V1 - http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/ 
* HTML Template - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element
* HTML Import (Blink only at the moment)

In the future I may add module support via a library and build step, but that's out of scope for the moment.
